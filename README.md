# Calculator-Application
This is a Calculator Based Java Application. I was just amazed on how much I've learned so far during college & during my own time at home that I decided to take a step further and build my own Calculator. I solely chose a calculator because I frequently use the Windows based Calculator Application if I don't have one by my side for quick calculations.
